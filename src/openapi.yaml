    Open Forms provides an API to manage multi-page or multi-step forms.

    It supports listing and retrieving forms, which are made up of form steps. Each form
    step has a form definition driven by [FormIO.js](https://github.com/formio/formio.js/)
    definitions.

    Submissions of forms are supported, where each form step can be submitted individually.
    Complete submissions are sent to the configured backend, which is a pluggable system
    to hook into [Open Zaak](https://openzaak.org), [Camunda](https://camunda.com/) or
    other systems.

    Open Forms fits in the [Common Ground](https://commonground.nl) vision and architecture,
    and it plays nice with other available components.

        Manage forms.

        Forms are collections of form steps, where each form step points to a formio.js
        form definition. Multiple definitions are combined in logical steps to build a
        multi-step/page form for end-users to fill out. Form definitions can be (and are)
        re-used among different forms.

        Mark the submission as completed.

        Submission completion requires that all required steps are completed.

        Note that the processing of the submission runs in the background, and you
        should periodically check the submission status endpoint to check the state.
        Background processing makes sure that:

        * potential appointments are registered
        * a report PDF is generated
        * the submission is persisted to the configured backend
        * payment is initiated if relevant

        Once a submission is completed, it's removed from the submission and time-stamped
        HMAC token URLs are used for subsequent process flow. This means it's no longer
        possible to change or read the submission data (including individual steps).
        This guarantees that the submission is removed from the session without having
        to rely on the client being able to make another call. IF it is detected in the
        status endpoint that a retry is needed, the ID is added back to the session.

        This endpoint provides information to start the payment flow for a submission.

        Due to support for legacy platforms this view doesn't redirect but provides information for the frontend to be used client side.

        Various validations are performed:
        * the form and submission must require payment
        * the `plugin_id` is configured on the form
        * payment is required and configured on the form
        * the `next` parameter must be present
        * the `next` parameter must match the CORS policy

        The HTTP 200 response contains the information to start the flow with the payment provider. Depending on the 'type', send a `GET` or `POST` request with the `data` as 'Form Data' to the given 'url'.

        Note that the discriminator field must exist at the same depth as the mapped serializer
        fields for the OpenAPI introspection. See
        https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/inheritance-and-polymorphism/ for
        more information. As such, it's not possible to define something like:

        {

            "polymorphic_context": {
                <foo-specific fields>
            }
        }

        without explicitly wrapping this in a parent serializer, i.e. - ``polymorphic_context``
        can not be a PolymorphicSerializer itself, as it requires access to the ``object_type``
        in the parent scope.

        A type of `ModelSerializer` that uses hyperlinked relationships with compound keys instead
        of primary key relationships.  Specifically:

        * A 'url' field is included instead of the 'id' field.
        * Relationships to other instances are hyperlinks, instead of primary keys.

        NOTE: this only works with DRF 3.1.0 and above.
