# Form modals

Form modals are variants of the normal modal with a flexbox layout so that the/a submit row in the
modal is pushed to the bottom.

**Warning**

In the code preview, you see that the props `parentSelector` and `ariaHideApp` are used - these
should NOT be used in real application code but exist solely for Storybook purposes.
