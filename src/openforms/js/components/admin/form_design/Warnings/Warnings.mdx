# Form Warnings

This component collects the components that display warnings in the form designer. It warns the user
about:

- Missing translations: if translations are enabled on the form but not all literals in the form
  have been translated.
- Multiple co-sign components: currently Open Forms supports only one co-sign component per form. If
  there are multiple, any extra component will be ignored.
- Multiple profile components: currently Open Forms supports only one profile component per form.
  With multiple profile components, we cannot guarantee that the profile data will be correctly
  saved to the 'klantinteracties' service. The form will be rendered with all the profile
  components.
- Missing authentication plugin: if the co-sign component is present and no authentication plugins
  are enabled on the form.
- Co-sign component in repeating groups: since only one co-sign component is allowed per form, it
  makes no sense to add them inside a repeating group.
