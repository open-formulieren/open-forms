    An API to manage Objects.

    # Introduction

    An OBJECT is of a certain OBJECTTYPE (defined in the Objecttypes API). An
    OBJECT has a few core attributes that every OBJECT (technically a RECORD,
    see below) has, although these attributes can sometimes be empty. They are
    attributes like `geometry` and some administrative attributes. The data that
    describes the actual object is stored in the `data` attribute and follows
    the JSON schema as given by the OBJECTTYPE.

    ## Validation

    When an OBJECT is created or changed the `OBJECT.type` attribute refers to the
    matching OBJECTTYPE in the Objecttypes API. The RECORD always indicates which
    OBJECTTYPE-VERSION is used, shown in the `RECORD.typeVersion` attribute.

    Using these 2 attributes, the appropriate JSON schema is retrieved from the
    Objecttypes API and the OBJECT data is validated against this JSON schema.

    ## History

    Each OBJECT has 1 or more RECORDs. A RECORD contains the data of an OBJECT
    at a certain time. An OBJECT can have multiple RECORDS that describe the
    history of that OBJECT. Changes to an OBJECT actually create a new RECORD
    under the OBJECT and leaves the old RECORD as is.

    ### Material and formal history

    History can be seen from 2 perspectives: formal and material history. The
    formal history describes the history as it should be (stored in the
    `startAt` and `endAt` attributes). The material history describes the
    history as it was administratively processed (stored in the `registeredAt`
    attribute).

    The difference is that an object could be created or updated in the real
    world at a certain point in time but the administrative change (ie. save or
    update the object in the Objects API) can be done at a later time. The
    query parameters `?date=2021-01-01` (formal history) and
    `?registrationDate=2021-01-01` (material history) allow for querying the
    RECORDS as seen from both perspectives, and can yield different results.

    ### Corrections

    RECORDs cannot be deleted or changed once saved. If an error was made to
    a RECORD, the RECORD can be "corrected" by saving a new RECORD and indicate
    that it corrects a previous RECORD. This is done via the attribute
    `correctionFor`.

    ### Deletion

    Although OBJECTs can be deleted, it is sometimes better to set the
    `endDate` of an OBJECT. Deleting an OBJECT also deletes all RECORDs in
    accordance with privacy laws.

    # Authorizations

    The API uses API-tokens that grant certain permissions. The API-token is
    passed via a header, like this: `Authorization: Token <token>`

          enum:
          - EPSG:4326
        description: 'The desired ''Coordinate Reference System'' (CRS) of the response
          data. According to the GeoJSON spec, WGS84 is the default (EPSG: 4326 is
          the same as WGS84).'

          Only include objects that have attributes with certain values.
          Data filtering expressions are comma-separated and are structured as follows:
          A valid parameter value has the form `key__operator__value`.
          `key` is the attribute name, `operator` is the comparison operator to be used and `value` is the attribute value.
          Note: Values can be string, numeric, or dates (ISO format; YYYY-MM-DD).

          Valid operator values are:
          * `exact` - equal to
          * `gt` - greater than
          * `gte` - greater than or equal to
          * `lt` - lower than
          * `lte` - lower than or equal to
          `value` may not contain double underscore or comma characters.
          `key` may not contain comma characters and includes double underscore only if it indicates nested attributes.

          Example: in order to display only objects with `height` equal to 100, query `data_attrs=height__exact__100`
          should be used. If `height` is nested inside `dimensions` attribute, query should look like
          `data_attrs=dimensions__height__exact__100`

                      Only include objects that have attributes with certain values.
                      Data filtering expressions are comma-separated and are structured as follows:
                      A valid parameter value has the form `key__operator__value`.
                      `key` is the attribute name, `operator` is the comparison operator to be used and `value` is the attribute value.
                      Note: Values can be string, numeric, or dates (ISO format; YYYY-MM-DD).

                      Valid operator values are:
                      * `exact` - equal to
                      * `gt` - greater than
                      * `gte` - greater than or equal to
                      * `lt` - lower than
                      * `lte` - lower than or equal to
                      `value` may not contain double underscore or comma characters.
                      `key` may not contain comma characters and includes double underscore only if it indicates nested attributes.

                      Example: in order to display only objects with `height` equal to 100, query `data_attrs=height__exact__100`
                      should be used. If `height` is nested inside `dimensions` attribute, query should look like
                      `data_attrs=dimensions__height__exact__100`
