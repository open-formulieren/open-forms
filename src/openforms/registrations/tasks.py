    Attempt to register the submission with the configured backend.

    Note that there are different triggers that can kick off this task:

    * form submission :func:`openforms.submissions.tasks.on_completion` flow
    * celery beat retry flow
    * admin action to retry the submission

    We should only allow a single registration attempt to run at a given time for a
    given submission. This is achieved through the :class:`QueueOnce` task base class
    from celery-once. While the task is already scheduled, subsequent schedule requests
    will not schedule the task _again_ to celery.

    Submission registration is only executed for "completed" forms, and is delegated
    to the underlying registration backend (if set).
