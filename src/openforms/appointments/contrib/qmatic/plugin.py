            numberOfCustomers will be used on all services when calculating the

            additionalCustomerDuration of 5 minutes will result in an appointment
            duration of 50 when minutes for 4 customers and 2 services.

        amount=3 for product 2, booking the appointment for 3 customers results in time
        for 3 people for each product (which is more than you need). Using 5 customers (
        2 + 3) would result in time reserved for 10 people and is incorrect in this
        situation.
