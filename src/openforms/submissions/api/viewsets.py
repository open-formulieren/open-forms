        Submission completion requires that all required steps are completed.

        Note that the processing of the submission runs in the background, and you
        should periodically check the submission status endpoint to check the state.
        Background processing makes sure that:

        This guarantees that the submission is removed from the session without having
        to rely on the client being able to make another call. IF it is detected in the
