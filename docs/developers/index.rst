Developer documentation
=======================

This documentation is intended for developer contributing to Open Forms itself, not for
people integrating with Open Forms.

.. note::

    If you're developing a client for Open Forms, please take a look at the OpenAPI 3
    specification in the root of the project or spin up an instance and visit the
    interactive documentation at ``http://localhost:8000/api/docs/``.

In :ref:`developers_architecture` we describe the high level architecture of Open Forms
and some core principles that impact the codebase structure. Please take a look to
familiarize yourself with the design principles.
