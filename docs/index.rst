Open Forms documentation
========================

Using **Open Forms** ("Open Formulieren" in Dutch), administrators can quickly
create powerful and smart forms that are exposed via an API. With the Open Forms
JavaScript `SDK`_, personalized forms can be retrieved and shown to the user.
The form blends in with an existing website using various styling options. Form
fields are pre-filled whenever possible and personalized choices are shown
depending on the user, if authenticated.

Using a plugin-based architecture, Open Forms allows for flexible submission
backends (e.g. `Open Zaak`_), authentication schemes, payment providers, calendar
apps and pre-fill services.

Open Forms is developed in line with the `Common Ground`_ principles,
specifically for municipalities and with a strong focus on usability for both
the civilian users and the administrator.
