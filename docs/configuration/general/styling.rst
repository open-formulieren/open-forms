Layout and styling
==================

Global configuration
--------------------

Via **Admin** > **Configuratie** > **Algemene configuratie**, section
**Organization configuration**, you can configure the look and feel of the forms and
html-email.

Organization name
    The organization name is used in link labels and document titles for accessibility
    reasons.

Main website link
    The main website link is used so the end-user can return to your main website, e.g.
    ``https://www.gemeente.nl``. Clicking the logo (or link) in the header will return the
    end-user to this URL.

Favicon
    You can upload your own favicon, typically displayed on the browser tab.

Default theme
    Open Forms supports configuring :ref:`multiple themes<configuration_general_styling_themes>`.
    In the event that no explicit theme is provided for content, the default theme (if set)
    is used.

    .. versionadded:: 2.5.0

        Support for multiple themes was added.

.. _configuration_general_styling_themes:

Themes
------

A theme is a collection of styling/appearance configuration. It is applied to the
web interface of a form, the confirmation email and the generated PDF with the submission
data.

Themes can be configured via **Admin** > **Configuratie** > **Thema's**. The customizable
aspects are:

Logo
    You can upload a logo to be used in the header here. If no logo is uploaded, a plain
    link will be shown. Logos can be the usual image formats, or an SVG image.

Theme CSS class name
    You can specify a CSS class name to apply to the root ``html`` element here. Typically
    you need this if you use an NL Design System design token package which emits the design
    tokens under this class name scope.

    Example value: ``<gemeente>-theme``.

    The `NL DS theme switcher`_ source code contains a list of built in themes and their
    class names.

Theme stylesheet URL
    If your organization publishes their design tokens as a package, you can use the
    resulting CSS file here by specifying the URL to the hosted stylesheet.

    The `NL DS theme switcher`_ source code contains a list of built in themes with
    available hosted stylesheets under the ``href`` key.

    .. note::

       If you are specifying an externally hosted stylesheet, then it will be
       blocked by default by the Content-Security-Policy (CSP).

       Navigate to **Admin** > **Configuratie** > **Csp settings** and add an entry to put
       this stylesheet on the allowlist. For the *directive* field, select ``style-src``,
       while the *Waarde* field should contain the (base) URL of the stylesheet, e.g.
       ``https://unpkg.com/@gemeente-denhaag/``.

    .. note::

        This configuration option is not supported in the HTML e-mail styling, please use
        the "design token values" for that instead.

        HTML e-mails have notoriously bad CSS support - this limitation is unfortunately
        outside of our hands.

Design token values

    With the design token values, you can control aspects such as back- and foreground
    colors in the skeleton. This is considered advanced usage, as the structure from
    `style dictionary`_ is used.

    All available design tokens can be consulted by opening the design token editor. As long
    as you use the default Open Forms theme, all tokens are optional and have default values.

.. _NL DS theme switcher: https://github.com/nl-design-system/themes/blob/main/packages/theme-switcher/src/index.js
.. _style dictionary: https://styledictionary.com/

.. todo::

    * Update e-mail to use design tokens from CSS file -> figure out if we can source a
      resolved JSON instead?
    * Refactor ``openforms.emails.context._get_design_token_values`` to be a template tag
      instead, e.g. ``{% design_token 'of.page-header.bg' default="#ffffff" %}`` which
      takes into account the entire resolution.
    * Optimize design tokens similarly to ``manifest.json`` so that it's kept in memory?
      This avoids network lookups (only update this when the config in admin changes)
      and even avoids file IO to build the resolved dictionary. We could include
      style-dict in the container image for this perhaps, but that requires NodeJS to
      be present... possibly set up a dedicated service for this.

Design token values examples
----------------------------

For 'inverted logos' it is possible to change the background colour of the header. The
design token values have to be set to:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "utrecht": {
        "page-header": {
          "background-color": {
            "value": "#35a7cc"
          }
        }
      }
    }

This gives:

.. image:: _assets/background-colour.png

For wider logos, it is possible to increase the size with the following design token values:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "of": {
        "header-logo": {
          "width": {
            "value": "400px"
          },
          "height": {
            "value": "75px"
          }
        }
      }
    }

Which gives:

.. image:: _assets/logo-size.png

Color presets for rich text content component
---------------------------------------------

Via **Admin** > **Miscellaneous** > **Text editor color presets** you can manage the shared color presets palette used by the rich text editor of the content-component.

You can freely add, change or remove presets to create a collection of consistent colors for use in free text. These are then available here:

.. image:: _assets/color_presets.png

.. note:: Changing the presets doesn't change text with previously applied colors.
