====================================
eHerkenning and eIDAS authentication
====================================

.. warning::

    This plugin cannot be configured via the admin interface and requires an
    update of the Open Forms installation.

Some forms can require authentication. Open Forms supports authentication
using `eHerkenning`_ and `eIDAS`_. To use eHerkenning and/or eIDAS, you must
have a contract with an `approved eHerkenning supplier`_.

Using eHerkenning for authentication will provide the KvK-number (chamber of
commerce number) of the authenticated company to the form context. Using the
KvK-number, certain fields can be
:ref:`prefilled <configuration_prefill_index>` with relevant personal data.

When using eIDAS, only a pseudoID is provided along with certain attributes
that describes the authenticated entity (person or company).

.. note::

    Open Forms currently only supports the same security level for all forms.

.. note::

    Authentication via eIDAS uses the same supplier and generated files as
    eHerkenning. If you plan on adding eIDAS support to Open Forms, it's best
    to do these 2 at the same time.


Step by step overview
=====================

1. Contact an `approved eHerkenning supplier`_ to get started. Sometimes, your
   Open Forms supplier can communicate directly with the eHerkenning supplier.
   Make sure you indicate if you want to connect using eHerkenning, eIDAS or
   both and what type of environment (test or production).

2. Request a `PKIoverheid Private Services Server G1`_ certificate at your
   `PKIO SSL certificate supplier`_. This is required for backchannel
   communication with your eHerkenning supplier (if you already have one for
   Open Forms, it can be re-used).

3. Send the following information to your Open Forms supplier:

   * Public and private certificate (obtained in step 2)
   * Name of the approved eHerkenning supplier
   * The desired consuming service indexes (or Service IDs)
   * Desired service name(s) in Dutch and English (for example: "Digitaal Loket")
   * Privacy policy URL of your main website
   * The `OIN`_ of your organization.

   Your Open Forms supplier will install the certificates in Open Forms,
   generate some XML metadata files and sends these back to you, or your
   eHerkenning supplier directly.

4. Your eHerkenning supplier will inform you when everything is set up.
