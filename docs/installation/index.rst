   production purposes
2. Run with :ref:`Docker-Compose <installation_docker_compose>` on your computer for private testing purposes
3. Run from `Python code`_ on your computer for development purposes

   If you don't want to install Open Forms yourself, you can ask an Open Forms
   supplier to host and manage it for you.
