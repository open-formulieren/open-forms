1.  Visit the source code of Open Forms in github and download the raw file:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wget https://github.com/open-formulieren/open-forms/blob/master/<name_of_the_file>

2.  Copy the downloaded file to the `/app/bin` folder in the container

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker cp <file_name> <container_id_or_name>:/app/bin

3.  Run the script
