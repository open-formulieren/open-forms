This is a wrapper around web-server specific methods for sending files to web
clients.  This is useful when Django needs to check permissions associated
files, but does not want to serve the actual bytes of the file itself.  i.e. as
serving large files is not what Django is made for.

Note this should not be used for regular file serving (e.g. css etc), only for
cases where you need Django to do some work before serving the actual file.
