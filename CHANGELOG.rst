      not required.
    * Skip validation for layout components, they never get data.
    * Ensure that empty string values for optional text fields are
      allowed (also covers derived fields).
    * Fixed validation error being returned that doesn't point to
      a particular component.

  or StUF-ZDS.

2.6.0 "Traiectum" (2024-03-25)
==============================

Open Forms 2.6.0 is a feature release.

.. epigraph::

   Traiectum is the name of a Roman Fort in Germania inferior, what is currently
   modern Utrecht. The remains of the fort are in the center of Utrecht.

Upgrade notes
-------------

* Ensure you upgrade to (at least) Open Forms 2.5.2 before upgrading to 2.6.

* ‚ö†Ô∏è The ``CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`` setting now requires items to have a scheme. E.g. if
  you specified this as ``example.com,cms.example.com``, then the value needs to be
  updated to ``https://example.com,https://cms.example.com``.

  Check (and update) your infrastructure code/configuration for this setting before
  deploying.

* The Objects API registration backend can now update the payment status after
  registering an object. For this feature to work, the minimum version of the Objects
  API is now ``v2.2`` (raised from ``v2.0``). If you don't make use of payments or don't
  store payment information in the object, you can likely keep using older versions, but
  this is at your own risk.

* The ``TWO_FACTOR_FORCE_OTP_ADMIN`` and ``TWO_FACTOR_PATCH_ADMIN`` environment variables
  are removed, you can remove them from your infrastructure configuration. Disabling MFA
  in the admin is no longer possible. Note that the OpenID Connect login backends do not
  require (additional) MFA in the admin and we've added support for hardware tokens
  (like the YubiKey) which make MFA less of a nuisance.

Major features
--------------

**üìÑ Objects API contract**

We completely revamped our Objects API registration backend - there is now tight
integration with the "contract" imposed by the selected object type. This makes it
much more user friendly to map form variables to properties defined in the object type.

The existing template-based approach is still available, giving you plenty of time to
convert existing forms. It is not scheduled for removal yet.

**üëî Decision engine (DMN) support**

At times, form logic can become very complex to capture all the business needs. We've
added support for evaluation of "Decision models" defined in a decision evaluation
engine, such as Camunda DMN. This provides a better user experience for the people
modelling the decisions, centralizes the definitions and gives more control to the
business, all while simplifying the form logic configuration.

Currently only Camunda 7 is supported, and using this feature requires you to have
access to a Camunda instance in your infrastructure.

**üîë Multi-factor rework**

We've improved the login flow for staff users by making it more secure *and* removing
friction:

* users of OIDC authentication never have to provide a second factor in Open Forms
* you can now set up an automatic redirect to the OIDC-provider, saving a couple of
  clicks
* users logging in with username/password can now use hardware tokens (like YubiKey),
  as an alternative one-time-password tokens (via apps like Google/Microsoft
  Authenticator)

**üîì Added explicit, public API endpoints**

We've explicitly divided up our API into public and private parts, and this is reflected
in the URLs. Public API endpoints can be used by CMS integrations to present lists of
available forms, for example. Public API endpoints are subject to semantic versioning,
i.e. we will not introduce breaking changes without bumping the major version.

Currently there are public endpoints for available form categories and available forms.
The existing, private, API endpoints will continue to work for the foreseeable future
to give integrations time to adapt. The performance of these endpoints is now optimized
too.

The other API endpoints are private unless documented otherwise. They are *not* subject
to our semantic versioning policy anymore, and using these is at your own risk. Changes
will continue to be documented in the release notes.

      property for better data quality.
    - Ensured that the legacy format is still available (100% backwards compatible).

2.6.0-alpha.0 (2024-02-20)
==========================

This is an alpha release, meaning it is not finished yet or suitable for production use.

Warnings
--------

**Objects API**

The Objects API registration backend can now update the payment status after registering
an object - this depends on a version of the Objects API with the PATCH method fixes. At
the time of writing, such a version has not been released yet.

.. todo:: At release time (2.6.0), check if we need to gate this functionality behind a
   feature flag to prevent issues.

If you would like information about the payment to be sent to the Object API registration
backend when the user submits a form, you can add a ``payment`` field to the
``JSON content template`` field in the settings for the Object API registration backend.
For example, if the ``JSON content template`` was:

.. code-block::

   {
     "data": {% json_summary %},
     "type": "{{ productaanvraag_type }}",
     "bsn": "{{ variables.auth_bsn }}",
     "pdf_url": "{{ submission.pdf_url }}",
     "submission_id": "{{ submission.kenmerk }}",
     "language_code": "{{ submission.language_code }}"
   }

It could become:

.. code-block::

  {
     "data": {% json_summary %},
     "type": "{{ productaanvraag_type }}",
     "bsn": "{{ variables.auth_bsn }}",
     "pdf_url": "{{ submission.pdf_url }}",
     "submission_id": "{{ submission.kenmerk }}",
     "language_code": "{{ submission.language_code }}"
     "payment": {
         "completed": {% if payment.completed %}true{% else %}false{% endif %},
         "amount": {{ payment.amount }},
         "public_order_ids":  {{ payment.public_order_ids }}
     }
  }

**Two factor authentication**

The ``TWO_FACTOR_FORCE_OTP_ADMIN`` and ``TWO_FACTOR_PATCH_ADMIN`` environment variables
are removed. Disabling MFA in the admin is no longer possible. Note that the OpenID
Connect login backends do not require (additional) MFA in the admin and we've added
support for hardware tokens (like the YubiKey) which make MFA less of a nuisance.

Detailed changes
----------------

**New features**

* [#713] Added JSON-template support for payment status update in the Objects API.
* [#3783] Added minimal statistics for form submissions in the admin.
* [#3793] Reworked the payment reference number generation to include the submission
  reference.
* [#3680] Removed extraneous authentication plugin configuration on cosign V2 component.
* [#3688] Added plumbing for improved objects API configuration to enforce data-constracts
  through json-schema validation. This is very work-in-progress.
* [#3730] Added DMN-capabilities to our logic engine. You can now evaluate a Camunda
  decision definition and use the outputs for further form logic control.
* [#3600] Added support for mapping form variables to case properties in the ZGW API's
  registration backend.
* [#3049] Reworked the two-factor solution. You can now enforce 2FA for username/password
  accounts while not requiring this when authenticating through OpenID Connect.
* Added support for WebAuthn-compatible 2FA hardware tokens.
* [#2617] Reworked the payment flow to only enter payment mode if the price is not zero.
* [#3727] Added validation for minimum/maximum number of checked options in the selectboxes
  component.
* [#3853] Added support for the KVK-Zoeken API v2.0. V1 is deprecated and will be shut
  down this year.

**Bugfixes**

* [#3616] Fixed broken PDF template for appointment data.
* [#3774] Fixed dark-mode support in new form builder.
* [#3382] Fixed translation warnings for date and datetime placeholders in the form
  builder.

* [#3623] Fixed some OpenID Connect compatibility issues with certain providers.
* [#3863] Fixed the generated XML for StUF-BG requests when retrieving partners/children.
* [#3864] Fixed handling of StUF-BG responses where one partner is returned.

   -- definition in Achterhoeks, Dutch dialect

Upgrade procedure
-----------------

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure you upgrade to Open Forms 2.4.0 before upgrading to the 2.5 release series.

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Please review the instructions in the documentation under **Installation** >
  **Upgrade details to Open Forms 2.5.0** before and during upgrading.

* We recommend running the ``bin/report_component_problems.py`` script to diagnose any
  problems in existing form definitions. These will be patched up during the upgrade,
  but it's good to know which form definitions will be touched in case something looks
  odd.

* Existing instances need to enable the new formio builder feature flag in the admin
  configuration.

Major features
--------------

**üèóÔ∏è Form builder rework**

We have taken lessons from the past into account and decided to implement our form
builder from the ground up so that we are not limited anymore by third party limitations.

The new form builder looks visually (mostly) the same, but the interface is a bit snappier
and much more accessible. Most importantly for us, it's now easier to change and extend
functionalities.

There are some further implementation details that have not been fully replaced yet,
but those do not affect the available functionality. We'll keep improving on this topic!

**üåê Translation improvements**

Doing the form builder rework was crucial to be able to improve on our translation
machinery of form field components. We've resolved the issues with translations in
fieldsets, repeating groups and columns *and* translations are now directly tied to
the component/field they apply too, making everything much more intuitive.

Additionally, in the translations table we are now able to provide more context to help
translators in providing the correct literals.

**üí∞ Payment flow rework**

Before this version, we would always register the submission in the configured backend
and then send an update when payment is fulfilled. Now, you can configure to only
perform the registration after payment is completed.

On top of that, we've updated the UI to make it more obvious to the end user that payment
is required.

**üè° BRK integration**

We've added support for the Basiregistratie Kadaster Haal Centraal API. You can now
validate that the authenticated user (DigiD) is "zaakgerechtigd" for the property at
a given address (postcode + number and suffixes).

**üßµ Embedding rework**

We have overhauled our embedding and redirect flows between backend and frontend. This
should now properly support all features when using hash based routing. Please let us
know if you run into any edge cases that don't work as expected yet!

**üß© More NL Design System components**

We've restructured page-scaffolding to make use of NL Design System components, which
makes your themes more reusable and portable accross different applications.


Detailed changes
----------------

The 2.5.0-alpha.0 changes are included as well, see the earlier changelog entry.

**New features**

   picture books authored by Dick Bruna. Both are famous Utrecht citizens. You can find
   Miffy in a number of places, such as the "Nijntje Pleintje" (Miffy Square) and a set
   of pedestrian traffic lights in the shape of the rabbit in the city center.

Upgrade procedure
-----------------

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure you upgrade to Open Forms 2.3.0 before upgrading to the 2.4 release series.

To keep the codebase maintainable and follow best pratices, we've done some considerable
cleanups in the code that may require some special attention. We've collected the
details for this release in a separate documentation page.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please review the instructions in the documentation under **Installation** >
**Upgrade details to Open Forms 2.4.0** before and during upgrading.

Major features

   -- "Cruquius, Netherlands", Wikipedia

Upgrade procedure
-----------------

Ensure that your current version of Open Forms is at least version 2.1.3 before
upgrading.

Version 2.3.0 does not contain breaking changes and therefore upgrading should be
straightforward.

Major features
--------------

**üìÖ Appointments**

We are introducing an all-new, optimized appointment booking flow, allowing you to make
appointments for multiple products and/or people in one go! The new user interface
focuses on better accessibility and a more fluent experience, while increasing the
flexibility for the organization managing appointments.

The JCC plugin is fully updated, while the Qmatic plugin is compatible. Please get in
touch if you use Qmatic and wish to use the multi-product flow.

The old appointment flow is now deprecated and will be removed in Open Forms 3.0.

**üßê Prefill with DigiD Machtigen/Bewindvoering**

Open Forms supports logging in with your own credentials on behalf of someone else (
you are then the authorisee, while "someone else" is the authoriser). Up until now,
prefill could only retrieve the data of the authoriser. Starting now, you can select
from which role the data should be prefilled, so you can retrieve this for all roles
at the same time!

**üó∫Ô∏è Map component**

We've improved the map component and/or geo integration:

* Configure the initial coordinates and zoom level of the map instead of the center of
  the Netherlands. This is even configurable *per component*, which can be useful if your
  organization has multiple districts, for example.
* Users now have a search box to look up their/an address, which autocompletes the
  addresses from the BAG. Clicking a suggestion places the marker on the coordinates of
  the selected address.
* Clicking a location in the map looks up the nearest address and displays this for
  extra confirmation.

**üß† Dynamic registration backends**

Registration backends are now dynamic - you can configure one, none or multiple
registration backends on a form and use logic to decide which to use. If no or only one
backend is configured, the existing behaviour applies. However, if you have multiple
possible backends, you must create a logic rule to select the appropriate backend.

Detailed changes
----------------

The 2.3.0-alpha.0 changes are included as well, see the earlier changelog entry.

**New features**

* [#2174] Added geo-search (using the Kadaster Locatieserver by default) for the map
  component.
* [#2017] The form step slug is now moved from the form definition to the form step
  itself, allowing you to use the same slug for a step in different forms.
* [#3332] Use the JCC configuration for the latest available appointment date.
* [#3332] When selecting a product, this choice is now taken into account to populate
  the list of available additional products.
* [#3321] Added support for new appointment flow to confirmation emails.
* [#1884] Added custom error message support for invalid times.
* [#3203, #3372] Added an additional checkbox for truth declaration before submitting a
  form, in addition to the privacy policy. You can now also configure these requirements
  per-form instead of only the global configuration.
* [#1889] Added the ``current_year`` static variable.
* [#3179] You can now use logic to select an appropriate registration backend.
* [#3299] Added Qmatic support for the new appointments.

**Bugfixes**

* [#3223] Fixed some content translations not being properly translated when copying a form.
* [#3144] Fixed file download links being absent in registration emails when the file
  upload is nested inside a group.
* [#3278] Fixed a crash when the DigiD provider does not provide a sector code in the
  SAML Artifact. We now assume it's BSN (as opposed to sofinummer).
* [#3084] Fixed ``inp.heeftAlsKinderen`` missing in scope of StUF-BG request.
* [#3302] Fixed race condition causing uploaded images not be resized.
* [#3332] Ensured that naive, localized appointment times are sent to JCC.
* [#3309] Added a missing automatic appointment configuration upgrade.
* Fixed broken inline images in outgoing emails and loss of additional parameters.
* [#3322] Fixed the cancel-appointment flow for new appointments.
* [#3327] Fixed the backend markup and styling of radio fields.
* [#3319] Fixed forms possibly sending a DigiD SAML request without assurance level due
  to misconfiguration.
* Fixed passing querystring parameter to service fetch.
* [#3277] Added a workaround to use form variable values containing spaces in templates.
* [#3292] Fixed dark mode suffixes in the form builder.
* [#3286] Fixed data normalization for customer details in new appointments.
* [#3368] Fixed a crash when empty values are returned from StUF-BG.
* [#3310] Fixed alignment issue in confirmation PDF for accepted privacy policy statement.

**Project maintenance**

* Changed the fail-fast behaviour of the end-to-end tests to reduce the flakiness impact.
* We now build Docker images based on the latest available Python patch release again.
* [#3242] Added more profiling to investigate test flakiness.
* Upgraded the container base image from Debian Bullseye to Bookworm.
* [#3127] Rework developer tooling to generate code from an API specification.
* Fixed JQ documentation URL for sorting.
* Bump dependencies reported to have vulnerabilities (via @dependabot).
* Improved typing of plugins and plugin registries.
* Fixed incorrect Authentication header in the Objects API documentation.
* [#3049] Upgraded more libraries to prepare for Django 4.2

2.3.0-alpha.0 (2023-07-24)
==========================

Upgrade procedure

This feature is currently in preview and only JCC is operational - but we're aiming to
finish support for QMatic in the full release.

**üßê Prefill with DigiD Machtigen/Bewindvoering**

Open Forms supports logging in with your own credentials on behalf of someone else (

from which role the data should be prefilled, so you can retrieve this for all roles
at the same time!

**üó∫Ô∏è Map component**

We are giving some the geo integration/map component some well-deserved love. The first
steps allow configuring the maps to your organization by setting a default initial
center and zoom level (global defaults), rather than initializing on the middle of the
Netherlands. You can even customize these defaults on a *per component* basis, for
example when your organization handles multiple districts.

More is coming!

Detailed changes
----------------

**New features**

     only JCC is fully implemented. Note that the entire feature has "preview"
     status and is only suitable for testing (with known issues).

    map component, with a global default.
  * [#3045] You can now provide a suffix for number components, e.g. to hint about the
    expected unit.

* [#3238] The StUF-ZDS registration backend now has well-defined behaviour for
  non-primitive variable values, including user-defined variables.

**Bugfixes**
