3.0.0 "Heerlijkheid" (2025-01-08)
=================================

Open Forms 3.0.0 is a feature release.

.. epigraph::

   Until the 19th century, the countryside of North and South Holland was divided into
   hundreds of small legal-administrative units, the 'lordships' (Heerlijkheid). The current 
   municipalities can be considered as a kind of successors of the former lordships. The release
   name reflects the influence of various large and smaller municipalities on this release.
   This is also a "lordly" release with many features, improvements and clean-ups.

This contains the changes from the alpha and fixes applied until the stable version.
BEFORE upgrading to 3.0.0, please read the release notes carefully and review the instructions
in the documentation under **Installation** > **Upgrade details to Open Forms 3.0.0**.

Upgrade procedure
-----------------
Open Forms 3.0 is a major version and contains a number of breaking changes. We've done a lot of
internal cleanups and removed old and deprecated features. Of course we were mindful in removing
only obsolete/unused features and we expect the impact to be minor.

To upgrade to 3.0, please:

* ⚠️ Ensure you upgrade to Open Forms 2.8.2 before upgrading to the 3.0 release series.

* ⚠️ Please review the instructions in the documentation under **Installation** >
  **Upgrade details to Open Forms 3.0.0** before and during upgrading. You can find
  details for the deprecated code and how this might affect you.
  
Where possible, we have included upgrade checks that can you inform about detected problems before
any database changes are made. We will add (some) of these checks to the next 2.8.x patch release
to so you can run them to explore possible impact.

Major features
--------------

**📥 Objects API Prefill (a.k.a. product prefill)**

If you store information about requests/products for users in the Objects API, you can now use this data
to populate a form. For example to request or renew the product (object) again. Bits of information from the referenced
record are prefilled into form fields and variables.

Additionally, you can opt to update the existing object rather than create a new one during registration!

An example is defined in :ref:`Prefill examples <examples_objects_prefill>`.

**🖋️ Cosign flow improvements**

We now provide a much more intuitive user experience to have someone cosign a form submission - users need
to click less and in general we removed a lot of friction for this process.

On top of that, the new configuration options for cosign allow you to tweak the content of emails and screens 
when cosigning is enabled in a form - from inviting someone to cosign to the confirmation page they get.

**💳 More powerful price calculations**

We made it simpler and more intuitive for form designers to define dynamic price logic rules - these are now
part of the regular logic rules. This also enables you to perform more complex calculations and interact with
external systems to retrieve pricing information!

**🛑 Limiting the amount of submissions**

You can now specify a maximum number of submissions for a given form, useful for limited availability/capacity
situations, such as raffles or sign-ups to events. Related to that, we expanded the statistics to allow exporting
the successfully registered submissions.

**🤖 Automatic technical configuration**

We're shipping some tooling for infrastructure teams that deploy Open Forms - this makes it possible to
provision some configuration aspects that previously had to be done in the admin interface via point-and-click.

We're still expanding on the covered configuration aspects, so stay tuned for more!

**🚸 User Experience improvements**

We have made a ton of user experience improvements in registration and prefill plugin configurations! No
more copying of URLs from other systems - instead, you select the relevant option in a dropdown.
Dropdowns that support a search field to wade through those tens or hundreds of available case types!

And, wherever you need to choose a form variable, you now have the options grouped by type of variable
*and* the context of where this variable occurs, topped of with a search field.

          - To avoid duplicating configuration, you can copy the configuration from a configured registration
            backend.

2.6.15 (2024-10-08)
===================

Final bugfix release in the ``2.6.x`` series.

* [#4602] Fixed missing Dutch translation for minimum required checked items error
  message in the selectboxes component.

2.8.0 "Drupa" (2024-10-02)
==========================

Open Forms 2.8.0 is a feature release.

.. epigraph::

   "Drupa" is an establishment close to the offices of the Open Forms development team.
   They have provided us with the necessary caffeinated beverages and occasional snack,
   and thus indirectly and unknowingly powered the development of Open Forms 😉.

   -- ☕

Upgrade notes
-------------

There are no manual actions required - all upgrades and migrations are automatic.

.. note:: The UX rework in the ZGW APIs registration plugin is not entirely finished
   yet. The Objects API integration in particular can be a bit confusing since it's not
   possible yet to select which Objects API should be used. The plugin now uses the API
   group that's listed first in the admin interface (**Admin** > **Miscellaneous** >
   **Objects API Groups**).

Major features
--------------

**📧 Email verification**

We added an additional (optional) layer of robustness for (confirmation) email delivery
and provide stronger guarantees about ownership of an email address.

You can now require email verification on email fields. Users submitting the form
receive a verification code on the provided email address, which they must enter to
confirm that it is indeed their email address. Forms with unverified email addresses
fail to submit and display useful error messages to the user.

**📜 Introduction page**

You can now define an optional introduction page that is shown *before* the users
starts the form submission. This is the ideal place to inform the users of the required
documents, what the procedure looks like or how long it typically takes to fill out the
form, for example.

**🚸 User experience (UX) improvements**

With Open Forms, we have every ambition to make work easier for form designers.
When setting up the registration plugins that process the form submissions especially
we knew we could make substantial improvements. For the Objects API's and ZGW API's
plugins, we have reduced the need to copy-and-paste "magic" hyperlinks and aim to remove
this need entirely in the future.

For the ZGW API's, this even means you don't have to worry anymore of updating the
configuration when you publish a new version of a "zaaktype" - the right version will
now automatically be selected.

Detailed changes
----------------

This contains the changes from the alpha, beta and fixes applied between the beta and
stable version.


**New features**

* [:backend:`4267`, :backend:`4567`, :backend:`4577`] Improved the UX of the Objects
  API registration options:

    - Configuration is now in a modal and changes in configuration require an explicit
      confirmation, meaning you can now explore more without potentially breaking the
      configuration.
    - Upgraded the API group, object type and object type version dropdowns with search
      functionality.
    - Configuration fields are now logically grouped. Optional settings are shown in a
      collapsed group to declutter the UI.
    - You can now select a catalogue from a dropdown (with search functionality) that
      contains the document types to use.
    - API groups (admin): you can now specify a catalogue and the descriptions of
      document types to use rather than entering the API URL to a specific version.

  These UX and configuration improvements are still work-in-progress, more will become
  available in next releases and we will also rework the ZGW API registration options.
* [:backend:`4051`] Added a better JSON-editor in a number of places, bringing them up
  to parity with the editor in the form builder:

    - Editing JSON logic triggers.
    - Editing JSON logic variable assignment expressions.
    - Editing service fetch mapping expressions.
    - Viewing the JSON-definition of logic rules and/or actions.
* [:backend:`4555`] Improved the UX of pre-fill configuration on the variables tab:

    - There is now a single summary column for the prefill configuration, instead of
      three separate columns.
    - Improved the wording/language used to differentiate between authorizee/authorised
      roles.
    - Editing the configuration is now done in a separate modal.

* [:backend:`4456`] The admin interface now clearly displays which environment you are
  on. You can disable displaying this information, and you can change the text and
  colors to easily differentiate between acceptance/production environments.
* [:backend:`4488`] The submisson report PDF now no longer opens in a new tab/window,
  the browser is forced to download it.
* [:backend:`4432`] Improved robustness in form designer interface when crashes occur
  because of external systems.
* [:backend:`4442`] Improved certificate handling and DigiD/eHerkenning via SAML
  configuration:

    - You can now upload password-protected private keys.
    - You can now configure multiple certificates for DigiD/eHerkenning. The "next"
      certificate will be included in the generated metadata so you can seamlessly
      transition when your old certificate is about to expire.
    - The metadata files are now forced as download to prevent formatting and copy/paste
      errors.

* You can now configure some django-log-outgoing-requests settings with environment
  variables.
* [:backend:`4575`] You can now configure the ``SENDFILE_BACKEND`` with an environment
  variable.
* [:backend:`4577`] We improved the user experience when configuring the Objects API
  registration plugin. Copy-pasting URLs is being phased out - you can now select the
  relevant configurations in dropdowns.
* [:backend:`4606`] Improved the user experience of the ZGW APIs registration plugin.
  We're making this consistent with the Objects API. More improvements will be done in
  the future.
* [:backend:`4542`] Email components now support optional verification - when enabled,
  users must verify their email address before they can continue submitting the form.
* [:backend:`4582`] The SAML metadata for the DigiD/eHerkenning identity providers is
  now automatically refreshed on a weekly basis.
* [:backend:`4380`] The StUF-ZDS registration plugin now supports sending payment
  details in the ``extraElementen`` data. For 2.7 this was available in an extension,
  which has been merged in core - migrating is automatic.
* [:backend:`4545`] You can now optionally configure an introduction page, which is
  displayed before the start of the form.
* [:backend:`4543`] You can now optionally enable a short progress summary showing the
  current step number and the total number of steps in a form.

.. note:: The ``addressNL`` component is not yet a fully capable replacement for
   individual address fields. Currently, it's only recommended for BRK-validation
   purposes.

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed a crash in the validation of form variables used in logic rules.
* [:backend:`4516`] Fixed imports (and error feedback) of legacy exports with Objects
  API registration backends. It should now be more clear that admins possibly need to
  check the Objects API groups configuration.
* [:backend:`4191`] Fixed a couple of bugs when adding a company as initator in the
  ZGW API's registration plugin:

    - Fixed the datatype of ``vestiging`` field in ZGW registration rollen/betrokkenen.
    - Fixed the ``aoaIdentificatie`` being empty - this is not allowed.

* [:backend:`4533`] Fixed Objects API registration options checkboxes not toggling.
* [:backend:`4502`] Fixed a problem where the registration-backend routing logic is not
  calculated again after pausing and resuming a submission.
* [:backend:`4334`] Fixed the email registration plugin not sending a payment-received
  email when "wait for payment to register" is enabled. This behaviour is to ensure that
  financial departments can always be informed of payment administration.
* [:backend:`4519`] Fixed form variable dropdowns taking up too much horizontal space.
* Backend checks of form component validation configuration are mandatory. All components
  support the same set of validation mechanism in frontend and backend.
* [:backend:`4560`] Fixed more PDF generation overlapping content issues. The layout no
  longer uses two columns, but just stacks the labels and answers below each other since
  a compromise was not feasible.
* Fixed upgrade check scripts for 2.7.x.
* [:backend:`4597`] Revert message for not-filled-in-fields in confirmation PDF back to
  just empty space.
* Fixed processing of empty file upload components in the Objects API registration plugin.
* Fixed an upgrade check incorrectly reporting problems.
* [:backend:`4627`] Fixed a crash in the eHerkenning-via-OIDC plugin if no ActingSubjectID
  claim is present.
* [:backend:`4602`] Fixed missing Dutch translation for minimum required checked items
  error message in the selectboxes component.
* [:backend:`4587`] Fixed the product not being copied along when copying a form.

**Project maintenance**

* [:backend:`4267`] Converted more existing tests from mocks to VCR.
* Added static type checking to the CI pipeline. We will continue to improve the
  type-safety of the code, which should result in fewer bugs and improve the developer
  experience.
* Upgraded a number of third-party packages.
* Simplified testing tools to test translation-enabled forms.
* [:backend:`4492`] Upload IDs are no longer stored in the session, which was obsoleted
  by relating uploads to a submission.
* [:backend:`4534`] Applied some memory-usage optimizations when interacting with the
  Catalogi API.
* Swapped out pip-tools with `uv <https://github.com/astral-sh/uv>`_ because it has much
  better performance.
* [:backend:`3197`] Upgraded to Python 3.12 from Python 3.10.
* Fixed some more sources of test flakiness.
* The random state from factory boy is now reported in CI to help reproduce test
  flakiness issues.
* [:backend:`4380`] There is now a mock service (docker-compose based) for a StUF-ZDS
  server.
* Added CI job to test upgrade check scripts/machinery.
* Addressed broken test isolation in CI leading to flaky tests.
* Upgraded a number of dependencies to their latest (security) releases.
* Improved the static type annotations in the codebase.
* Failing end-to-end tests now produce Playwright traces in CI to help debug the problem.
* Added a utility script to find VCR cassette directories.
* [:backend:`4646`, :backend:`4396`] Restructured the Objects API configuration to be
  in a shared code package, which can be used by the registration and prefill plugins.
* [:backend:`4648`] Corrected the documentation about the minimum PostgreSQL version
  (v12) and confirmed support for PostgreSQL 15.
* Squashed migrations.

2.7.0 "Berlage" (2024-07-09)
============================

Open Forms 2.7.0 is a feature release.

.. epigraph::

   Maykin was founded in 2008 and originally located in the 'Beurs van Berlage' in
   Amsterdam. The monumental building, designed by Hendrik Petrus Berlage and build
   around 1900, inspired us to create innovative applications, of which some are still
   maintained and in production to this day.

Upgrade notes
-------------

* ⚠️ The feature flag to disable backend validation is now removed, instances relying
  on it should verify that their forms still work now that validation is enforced.

* ⚠️ If you make use of the Objects API - even the legacy configuration, you now need
  to have a valid configuration for the objecttypes API service. The plugin
  accesses this API during registration. You can configure this for each api group via
  **Admin > Overige > Objecten API-groepen** after upgrading to 2.7.

* We're consolidating the OpenID Connect *Redirect URI* endpoints into a single
  endpoint: ``/auth/oidc/callback/``. The legacy endpoints are still enabled,
  but scheduled for removal in Open Forms 3.0.

  You can opt-in to the new behaviour through three environment variables (and we
  recommend doing so on fresh instances):

  - ``USE_LEGACY_OIDC_ENDPOINTS=false``: admin login
  - ``USE_LEGACY_DIGID_EH_OIDC_ENDPOINTS=false``: DigiD/eHerkenning plugins
  - ``USE_LEGACY_ORG_OIDC_ENDPOINTS=false``: Organization OIDC plugin

  Note that the OpenID applications need to be updated on the identity provider,
  specifically the allowed "Redirect URIs" setting needs to be updated with the
  following path replacements:

  - ``/oidc/callback/`` -> ``/auth/oidc/callback/``
  - ``/digid-oidc/callback/`` -> ``/auth/oidc/callback/``
  - ``/eherkenning-oidc/callback/`` -> ``/auth/oidc/callback/``
  - ``/digid-machtigen-oidc/callback/`` -> ``/auth/oidc/callback/``
  - ``/eherkenning-bewindvoering-oidc/callback/`` -> ``/auth/oidc/callback/``
  - ``/org-oidc/callback/`` -> ``/auth/oidc/callback/``

* We are deprecating location autofill in ``textfield`` components. Instead, use the
  ``addressNL`` component and enable address derivation.

Major features
--------------

**🛂 Mandates ("machtigen") for DigiD and eHerkenning**

We now provide better integration for DigiD Machtigen and eHerkenning Bewindvoering (
via OpenID Connect). Open Forms registers the details in which capacity a user is
logged in and whether a mandate is used or not.

This information is available during the registration of a form submission, making it
possible to register it to the Objects API and ZGW API's for further processing.

**📍 Dutch addresses**

We're making it easier to deal with Dutch addresses.

The ``addressNL`` component is meant for these - it (optionally) integrates with the
Kadaster API to derive street name and city from the provided postcode and house number,
while making sure the full address details are sent to the registration plugins.

Support for single-column layout was added so that the layout can adapt to your
organization's form design.

We're adding more flexbility to better integrate with registration plugins, so keep an
eye on this component for Open Forms 2.8.

**🚸 User experience improvements in the form designer**

Staff users typically spend a lot of time in the form designer to create or update
forms. We're making some changes to improve the user experience so that it becomes
easier to:

* configure forms, and make configuration less error-prone with better UI elements
* export and import forms across environments (staging -> production, for example)
* detect problems and configuration issues

2.6.0 "Traiectum" (2024-03-25)
==============================

Open Forms 2.6.0 is a feature release.

.. epigraph::

   Traiectum is the name of a Roman Fort in Germania inferior, what is currently
   modern Utrecht. The remains of the fort are in the center of Utrecht.

Upgrade notes
-------------

* Ensure you upgrade to (at least) Open Forms 2.5.2 before upgrading to 2.6.

* ⚠️ The ``CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`` setting now requires items to have a scheme. E.g. if
  you specified this as ``example.com,cms.example.com``, then the value needs to be
  updated to ``https://example.com,https://cms.example.com``.

  Check (and update) your infrastructure code/configuration for this setting before
  deploying.

* The Objects API registration backend can now update the payment status after
  registering an object. For this feature to work, the minimum version of the Objects
  API is now ``v2.2`` (raised from ``v2.0``). If you don't make use of payments or don't
  store payment information in the object, you can likely keep using older versions, but
  this is at your own risk.

* The ``TWO_FACTOR_FORCE_OTP_ADMIN`` and ``TWO_FACTOR_PATCH_ADMIN`` environment variables
  are removed, you can remove them from your infrastructure configuration. Disabling MFA
  in the admin is no longer possible. Note that the OpenID Connect login backends do not
  require (additional) MFA in the admin and we've added support for hardware tokens
  (like the YubiKey) which make MFA less of a nuisance.

Major features
--------------

**📄 Objects API contract**

We completely revamped our Objects API registration backend - there is now tight
integration with the "contract" imposed by the selected object type. This makes it
much more user friendly to map form variables to properties defined in the object type.

The existing template-based approach is still available, giving you plenty of time to
convert existing forms. It is not scheduled for removal yet.

**👔 Decision engine (DMN) support**

At times, form logic can become very complex to capture all the business needs. We've
added support for evaluation of "Decision models" defined in a decision evaluation
engine, such as Camunda DMN. This provides a better user experience for the people
modelling the decisions, centralizes the definitions and gives more control to the
business, all while simplifying the form logic configuration.

Currently only Camunda 7 is supported, and using this feature requires you to have
access to a Camunda instance in your infrastructure.

**🔑 Multi-factor rework**

We've improved the login flow for staff users by making it more secure *and* removing
friction:

* users of OIDC authentication never have to provide a second factor in Open Forms
* you can now set up an automatic redirect to the OIDC-provider, saving a couple of
  clicks
* users logging in with username/password can now use hardware tokens (like YubiKey),
  as an alternative one-time-password tokens (via apps like Google/Microsoft
  Authenticator)

**🔓 Added explicit, public API endpoints**

We've explicitly divided up our API into public and private parts, and this is reflected
in the URLs. Public API endpoints can be used by CMS integrations to present lists of
available forms, for example. Public API endpoints are subject to semantic versioning,
i.e. we will not introduce breaking changes without bumping the major version.

Currently there are public endpoints for available form categories and available forms.
The existing, private, API endpoints will continue to work for the foreseeable future
to give integrations time to adapt. The performance of these endpoints is now optimized
too.

The other API endpoints are private unless documented otherwise. They are *not* subject
to our semantic versioning policy anymore, and using these is at your own risk. Changes
will continue to be documented in the release notes.

2.6.0-alpha.0 (2024-02-20)
==========================

This is an alpha release, meaning it is not finished yet or suitable for production use.

Warnings
--------

**Objects API**

The Objects API registration backend can now update the payment status after registering
an object - this depends on a version of the Objects API with the PATCH method fixes. At
the time of writing, such a version has not been released yet.

.. todo:: At release time (2.6.0), check if we need to gate this functionality behind a
   feature flag to prevent issues.

If you would like information about the payment to be sent to the Object API registration
backend when the user submits a form, you can add a ``payment`` field to the
``JSON content template`` field in the settings for the Object API registration backend.
For example, if the ``JSON content template`` was:

.. code-block::

   {
     "data": {% json_summary %},
     "type": "{{ productaanvraag_type }}",
     "bsn": "{{ variables.auth_bsn }}",
     "pdf_url": "{{ submission.pdf_url }}",
     "submission_id": "{{ submission.kenmerk }}",
     "language_code": "{{ submission.language_code }}"
   }

It could become:

.. code-block::

  {
     "data": {% json_summary %},
     "type": "{{ productaanvraag_type }}",
     "bsn": "{{ variables.auth_bsn }}",
     "pdf_url": "{{ submission.pdf_url }}",
     "submission_id": "{{ submission.kenmerk }}",
     "language_code": "{{ submission.language_code }}"
     "payment": {
         "completed": {% if payment.completed %}true{% else %}false{% endif %},
         "amount": {{ payment.amount }},
         "public_order_ids":  {{ payment.public_order_ids }}
     }
  }

**Two factor authentication**

The ``TWO_FACTOR_FORCE_OTP_ADMIN`` and ``TWO_FACTOR_PATCH_ADMIN`` environment variables
are removed. Disabling MFA in the admin is no longer possible. Note that the OpenID
Connect login backends do not require (additional) MFA in the admin and we've added
support for hardware tokens (like the YubiKey) which make MFA less of a nuisance.

Detailed changes
----------------

**New features**

* [:backend:`713`] Added JSON-template support for payment status update in the Objects API.
* [:backend:`3783`] Added minimal statistics for form submissions in the admin.
* [:backend:`3793`] Reworked the payment reference number generation to include the submission
  reference.
* [:backend:`3680`] Removed extraneous authentication plugin configuration on cosign V2 component.
* [:backend:`3688`] Added plumbing for improved objects API configuration to enforce data-constracts
  through json-schema validation. This is very work-in-progress.

  decision definition and use the outputs for further form logic control.
* [:backend:`3600`] Added support for mapping form variables to case properties in the ZGW API's
  registration backend.
* [:backend:`3049`] Reworked the two-factor solution. You can now enforce 2FA for username/password
  accounts while not requiring this when authenticating through OpenID Connect.
* Added support for WebAuthn-compatible 2FA hardware tokens.
* [:backend:`2617`] Reworked the payment flow to only enter payment mode if the price is not zero.
* [:backend:`3727`] Added validation for minimum/maximum number of checked options in the selectboxes
  component.
* [:backend:`3853`] Added support for the KVK-Zoeken API v2.0. V1 is deprecated and will be shut
  down this year.

**Bugfixes**

* [:backend:`3809`] Fixed a crash when viewing a non-existing submission via the admin.
* [:backend:`3616`] Fixed broken PDF template for appointment data.
* [:backend:`3774`] Fixed dark-mode support in new form builder.
* [:backend:`3382`] Fixed translation warnings for date and datetime placeholders in the form
  builder.
* [:cve:`CVE-2024-24771`] Fixed (non-exploitable) multi-factor authentication weakness.

.. epigraph::

   Noaberschap of naoberschap bunt de gezamenleke noabers in ne kleine sociale,
   oaverweagend agrarische samenleaving. Binnen den noaberschap besteet de noaberplicht.
   Dit höldt de verplichting in, dat de noabers mekare bi-j mot stoan in road en doad as

   Bentheim en umgeaving).

   -- definition in Achterhoeks, Dutch dialect

Upgrade procedure
-----------------

* ⚠️ Ensure you upgrade to Open Forms 2.4.0 before upgrading to the 2.5 release series.

* ⚠️ Please review the instructions in the documentation under **Installation** >
  **Upgrade details to Open Forms 2.5.0** before and during upgrading.

* We recommend running the ``bin/report_component_problems.py`` script to diagnose any
  problems in existing form definitions. These will be patched up during the upgrade,
  but it's good to know which form definitions will be touched in case something looks
  odd.

* Existing instances need to enable the new formio builder feature flag in the admin
  configuration.

Major features
--------------

**🏗️ Form builder rework**

We have taken lessons from the past into account and decided to implement our form
builder from the ground up so that we are not limited anymore by third party limitations.

The new form builder looks visually (mostly) the same, but the interface is a bit snappier
and much more accessible. Most importantly for us, it's now easier to change and extend
functionalities.

There are some further implementation details that have not been fully replaced yet,
but those do not affect the available functionality. We'll keep improving on this topic!

**🌐 Translation improvements**

Doing the form builder rework was crucial to be able to improve on our translation
machinery of form field components. We've resolved the issues with translations in
fieldsets, repeating groups and columns *and* translations are now directly tied to
the component/field they apply too, making everything much more intuitive.

Additionally, in the translations table we are now able to provide more context to help
translators in providing the correct literals.

**💰 Payment flow rework**

Before this version, we would always register the submission in the configured backend
and then send an update when payment is fulfilled. Now, you can configure to only
perform the registration after payment is completed.

On top of that, we've updated the UI to make it more obvious to the end user that payment
is required.

**🏡 BRK integration**

We've added support for the Basiregistratie Kadaster Haal Centraal API. You can now
validate that the authenticated user (DigiD) is "zaakgerechtigd" for the property at
a given address (postcode + number and suffixes).

**🧵 Embedding rework**

We have overhauled our embedding and redirect flows between backend and frontend. This
should now properly support all features when using hash based routing. Please let us
know if you run into any edge cases that don't work as expected yet!

**🧩 More NL Design System components**

We've restructured page-scaffolding to make use of NL Design System components, which
makes your themes more reusable and portable accross different applications.


Detailed changes
----------------

The 2.5.0-alpha.0 changes are included as well, see the earlier changelog entry.

**New features**

* Form designer

    * [:backend:`3712`] Replaced the form builder with our own implementation. The feature flag is

* Registration plugins

    * [:backend:`3601`], ZGW plugin: you can now register (part of) the submission data in the
      Objects API, and it will be related to the created Zaak.

      ⚠️ This requires a compatible version of the Objects API, see the
      `upstream issue <https://github.com/maykinmedia/objects-api/issues/355>`_.

2.5.0-alpha.0 (2023-12-15)
==========================

This is an alpha release, meaning it is not finished yet or suitable for production use.

Upgrade procedure
-----------------

⚠️ Ensure you upgrade to Open Forms 2.4.0 before upgrading to the 2.5 release series.

⚠️ Please review the instructions in the documentation under **Installation** >
**Upgrade details to Open Forms 2.5.0** before and during upgrading.

Detailed changes
----------------

**New features**

* [:backend:`3178`] Replaced more custom components with NL Design System components for improved
  themeing. You can now use design tokens for:

  * ``utrecht-document``
  * ``utrecht-page``
  * ``utrecht-page-header``
  * ``utrecht-page-footer``
  * ``utrecht-page-content``

* [:backend:`3573`] Added support for sending geo (Point2D) coordinates as GeoJSON to the Objects API.
* Added CSP ``object-src`` directive to settings (preventing embedding by default).
* Upgraded the version of the new (experimental) form builder.
* [:backend:`3559`] Added support for Piwik PRO Tag Manager as an alternative for Piwik PRO Analytics.
* [:backend:`3403`] Added support for multiple themes. You can now configure a default theme and
  specify form-specific styles to apply.
* [:backend:`3649`] Improved support for different vendors of the Documenten API implementation.
* [:backend:`3651`] The suffix to a field label for optional fields now uses simpler language.
* [:backend:`3005`] Submission processing can now be deferred until payment is completed (when
  relevant).

**Bugfixes**

* [:backend:`3362`] We've reworked and fixed the flow to redirect from the backend back to the
  form in the frontend, fixing the issues with hash-based routing in the process.
  Resuming forms after pausing, cosign flows... should now all work properly when you
  use hash-based routing.
* [:backend:`3548`] Fixed not being able to remove the MS Graph service/registration configuration.
* [:backend:`3604`] Fixed a regression in the Objects API and ZGW API's registration backends. The
  required ``Content-Crs`` request header was no longer sent in outgoing requests after
  the API client refactoring.
* [:backend:`3625`] Fixed crashes during StUF response parsing when certain ``nil`` values are
  present.
* Updated the CSP ``frame-ancestors`` directive to match the ``X-Frame-Options``
  configuration.
* [:backend:`3605`] Fixed unintended number localization in StUF/SOAP messages.
* [:backend:`3613`] Fixed submission resume flow not sending the user through the authentication
  flow again when they authenticated for forms that have optional authentication. This
  unfortunately resulted in hashed BSNs being sent to registration backends, which we
  can not recover/translate back to the plain-text values.
* [:backend:`3641`] Fixed the DigiD/eHerkenning authentication flows aborting when the user
  changes connection/IP address.
* [:backend:`3647`] Fixed a backend (logic check) crash when non-parsable time, date or datetime
  values are passed. The values are now ignored as if nothing was submitted.

**Project maintenance**

* Deleted dead/unused CSS.
* Upgraded dependencies having new patch/security releases.
* [:backend:`3620`] Upgraded storybook to v7.
* Updated the Docker image workflow, OS packages are now upgraded during the build and
  image vulnerability scanning added to the CI pipeline.
* Fixed generic type hinting of registry.
* [:backend:`3558`] Refactored the CSP setting generation from analytics configuration mechanism
  to be more resilient.
* Ensured that we send tracebacks to Sentry on DigiD errors.
* Refactored card component usage to use the component from the SDK.
* Upgraded WeasyPrint for PDF generation.
* [:backend:`3049`] Replaced deprecated calls to ``ugettext*``.
* Fixed a deprecation warning when using new-style middlewares.
* [:backend:`3005`] Simplified/refactored the task orchestration for submission processing.
* Require OF to be minimum of 2.4 before upgrading to 2.5.
* Removed original source migrations that were squashed in Open Forms 2.4.
* Replaced some (vendored) code with their equivalent library versions.
* Upgraded the NodeJS version from v16 to v20.
