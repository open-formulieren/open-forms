.. note::

    The Dutch version of this changelog can be found :ref:`here <changelog-nl>`.

3.2.1 (2025-08-19)
==================

Regular bugfix release.

.. note:: Worldline is ending support for Ogone Legacy at the end of 2025. Open Forms 3.3.0 will
   have support for the replacement. To make migrating easier, we've added new configuration options
   for the replacement:

   * *API Key* and *API Secret* fields for the merchants
   * Webhook configuration

   You can find these via configuration overview page. They are currently not used, but will make the
   automatic migration easier in Open Forms 3.3.0.

* [:backend:`4879`] Added fields to the `Ogone Merchant` and added the
  `Ogone webhook configuration`.
* [:backend:`5413`] Fixed uploading filenames with soft-hyphens not passing form validation.
* [:backend:`5471`] Fixed BRP "doelbinding" advanced options not becoming available
  when using family members components.
* [:backend:`5481`] Fixed incorrect lookup of the prefill-variable for a partners
  component variable.
* [:backend:`5271`] Fixed false positives being reported in the digest email when you
  have logic rules that use the ``reduce`` operation.
* [:backend:`5454`] Fixed Piwik Pro debug mode no longer working.

3.2.0 "Nimma" (2025-07-11)
==========================

Open Forms 3.2.0 is a feature release.

.. epigraph::

    "Nimma" is an informal, affectionate nickname for one of the oldest cities in the Netherlands: Nijmegen.
    The name is often used by locals and conveys a sense of pride, solidarity, and personal identity.
    Naturally, we are also proud of the fact that Nijmegen contributes to Open Forms.

This contains the changes from the alpha releases and fixes applied until the stable version.
BEFORE upgrading to 3.2.0, please read the release notes carefully and review the following
instructions.

Upgrade procedure
-----------------

.. warning::

   The Camunda registration backend will be removed in Open Forms 4.0. There is no
   replacement scheduled - if you rely on this plugin, please get in touch.

.. warning::

    For the Generic JSON registration plugin, we changed the way that the data is generated.
    In case of key conflicts between static, component, and user-defined variables,
    the static variables will take precedence. Previously, the component and user-defined
    variables would override the static variables. Our validation guards against the use of
    keys that are already present in the static variables, but this does not cover old forms
    and newly-added static variables.

Major features
--------------

**üîä Improved logging**

    We improved the logs that are emitted by the application, which enable better integration with observability
    tooling like Grafana.

**üõÇ Authentication using Yivi and eIDAS**

    We implemented support for `Yivi <https://yivi.app/>`_ and `eIDAS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS>`_
    authentication via the OpenID Connect protocol. With support for Yivi authentication, end-users can decide which
    personal information they want to share with Open Forms.

    Support for eIDAS will allow European citizens without a DigiD (and/or BSN) to have access to forms which
    require authentication.

**üë´ Partners component with prefill**

    We added a partners component, where information such as initials, last name, and date of birth of a
    partner can be shown or provided.

    This component can be prefilled using a new family members prefill plugin, that allows retrieving data from
    "Haal Centraal BRP personen bevragen" (version 2) or "StUF-BG" (version 3.1).

**üìù JSON schema generation**

    We added the possibility to generate a JSON schema of a form. It describes the submission data of all user-defined
    and component variables, and can be generated for the Generic JSON and Objects API registrations in the shape of
    the data produced by either of those plugins.

    The schemas of component variables also include a description and validation rules if they were specified
    in the configuration of these components.

    We included a script to remove corrupt API group configuration to make the upgrade
    to Open Forms 3.0 easier. This script removes API groups (Objects API and ZGW APIs)
    for which *no* services have been configured.

3.1.0 "Lente" (2025-03-31)
==========================

Open Forms 3.1.0 is a feature release.

.. epigraph::

    "Lente" is Dutch for "Spring". We've planted some seeds that will take time to
    bloom before their full potential is visible, but here and there you can already
    spot some flowers. Spring is typically a time in the year that's lighter and brings
    more joy, and we hope this release will do too.

This contains the changes from the alpha and fixes applied until the stable version.
BEFORE upgrading to 3.1.0, please read the release notes carefully and review the
following instructions.

Upgrade procedure
-----------------

To upgrade to 3.1, please:

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure you upgrade to Open Forms 3.0.1 before upgrading to the 3.1 release series.

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Verify the amount of log records before applying the upgrade. [:backend:`4931`]
  introduced a migration which processes log records and therefore could take a
  long time to complete.

* We recommend running the ``bin/report_component_problems.py`` and
  ``bin/report_form_registration_problems.py`` scripts to diagnose any problems in
  existing form definitions. These will be patched up during the upgrade, but it's good
  to know which form definitions will be touched in case something looks odd. The scripts
  are also available in the latest 3.0.x patch release, so you can run them before
  starting the upgrade process.

* Due to some UX rework in the SDK, you may need to define additional design tokens if
  you use a custom theme.

* We never deliberately supported HTML in component labels/tooltips. Due to some
  additional sanitation being added, some elements may now be escaped. We urge you to
  **NOT** use HTML in places that don't have a rich text editor.

Where possible, we have included upgrade checks that can you inform about detected problems before
any database changes are made.

Major features
--------------

**üìí Referentielijsten API integration**

We added support for the Referentielijsten API to Open Forms. In that API, you can
centrally manage (semi) fixed lists of data, such as districts, communication channels,
days of the week...

These reference lists can be used in Open Forms to populate the possible options in
select, selectboxes and radio components, making it easier to re-use these across forms.

**üì¶ JSON Dump registration**

We added a new registration plugin that allows for the simple transfer of form
variables and metadata in JSON format to a configured service. Form designers can select
which variabels to send to this external API, and then the values and schema describing
the structure of the variables is sent as JSON, making it easy to process the data.

**üó∫ Map component rework**

The map component has undergone a major rework to support a wider range of use cases.

The most notable change is the expanded range of possible interactions users can have
with the map component. Previously, only pin placement was supported. This has now been
extended to include drawing multi-point lines and polygons.

You can now also use alternative background ("tile") layers (e.g. aerial imagery)
instead of the default BRT layer from the Kadaster.

.. note:: The ``map`` component rework is not complete yet and some more improvements
   are needed to optimize the user experience.

**‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility improvements**

Improving accessibility is a continuous effort, but in this release in particular we
could focus on it more. The submission summary PDFs have been made much more accessible
and informative. The form navigation for end-users has had an overhaul - backed by
proper research and user tests - particularly improving the experience on wide screen
devices.

The form designers should also see some (smaller) UX improvements, making it a bit
easier to manage form variables and creating a better overview.

**New features**

* [:backend:`5137`] The request header name for the ``OIN`` sent in "Haal Centraal BRP
  Personen bevragen" is now configurable.
* [:backend:`5122`] Clarified the help-text for the Ogone legacy ``TITLE`` and ``COM``
  parameters.
* [:backend:`5074`] Added an option to send the data from the selectboxes component as
  a list to the Objects API and JSON Dump registrations.
* UX: variables are now grouped by form step in the variables tab.
* [:backend:`5047`] Improved the accessibility of the submission summary PDF.

    - Added a textual alternative to the logo.
    - Provided an semantic relationship between the form field label and user provided
      value.
    - The PDF displays "No information provided" for form fields that haven't been
      filled in by the user.

* [:backend:`4991`, :backend:`4993`, :backend:`5016`, :backend:`5107`, :backend:`5106`,
  :backend:`5178`] Added Referentielijsten API support. You can now use reference lists
  as source for select, radio and selectboxes component options.

    - Allow using the referentielijsten as data source, which requires selecting a service
      and table to use.
    - We're prepared for multi-language support already.
    - Administrators get notified of expiring/expired tables and/or items.

* [:backend:`4518`] Added prefill attempts to the submission log entries.
* Performance improvements regarding fetching and processing form data.
* [:backend:`4990`] Registration variables in the form variables tab now show from which
  registration backend they originate.
* [:backend:`5093`, :backend:`5184`] Improved user experience when working with array or
  object values in the form variables table.
* [:backend:`5024`] Loosened validation on ZGW APIs and Objects API registration
  backends to support a broader range of vendors.
* [:backend:`2177`] Changed the map component output to GeoJSON geometry, allowing lines
  and polygons to be drawn on map components in addition to point markers.
* [:backend:`4908`, :backend:`4980`, :backend:`5012`, :backend:`5066`] Added new
  JSON Dump registration plugin.

    - Form designers control which variables get sent to the configured service.

      each variable.
    - Includes fixed and configurable metadata of the form/submission.

* [:backend:`4931`] Upgraded the form submission statistics to reflect actual submissions
  and added the ability to export the results based on various filters.
* [:backend:`4785`] Updated the eHerkenning metadata generation to match the latest
  standard version(s).

**Minor security improvements**

We addressed some minor security concerns in case a rogue employee has access to the
admin interface.

* Administrators are no-longer able to change the submission summary PDF through the
  admin interface.
* SVGs uploaded through the admin interface, used for logos and favicons, are now
  automatically sanitized.
* The form preview seen by form designers in the admin now applies extra HTML sanitation
  on the client side. The backend already properly escaped this and the public UI was
  never affected.

  plugin.
* [:backend:`4825`] Fixed prefill reporting false failures to daily digest when multiple
  authentication flows are used.

3.0.6 (2025-03-17)
==================

Regular bugfix release.

.. warning:: Manual intervention required

    In the 3.0.2 bugfix release we fixed a bug regarding Objects API registration not
    being shown in the variables tab, and in 3.0.6 we fixed a bug regarding the default
    values of radio fields being ``null``. In this bugfix we added scripts to fix any forms
    that still might be affected by these issues. You should run these scripts after
    deploying the patch release, to make sure all Objects API registrations are correctly
    configured, and the default values of radio fields are fixed.

    .. code-block:: bash

        # in the container via ``docker exec`` or ``kubectl exec``:
        python /app/bin/fix_objects_api_form_registration_variables_mapping.py
        python /app/bin/fix_radio_component_default_values.py

    Alternatively, you can also manually edit all the affected forms in the
    admin interface. For the Objects API, this would require you to remove the Objects API
    registrations, and re-define them. For the radio fields, this would require you to change
    the ``defaultValue`` of all radio components from ``null`` to an empty string ``""``.


**Bugfixes**

* [:backend:`5158`] Fixed not being able to delete ZGW API groups.
* [:backend:`5142`] Fixed logic tab crashing and incorrectly displaying 0 component
  variables when removing fields from the form.
* [:backend:`5124`] Fixed hidden prefill fields triggering validation.
* [:backend:`5031`] Fixed missing ``variables_mapping`` in the Objects API registration
  plugin.
* [:backend:`5104`] Fixed ``null`` default values for radio fields.

2.8.7 (2025-03-17)
==================

Regular bugfix release.

.. warning:: Manual intervention required

    In the 2.8.4 bugfix release we fixed a bug regarding Objects API registration not
    being shown in the variables tab, and in 2.8.7 we fixed a bug regarding the default
    values of radio fields being ``null``. In this bugfix we added scripts to fix any forms
    that still might be affected by these issues. You should run these scripts after
    deploying the patch release, to make sure all Objects API registrations are correctly
    configured, and the default values of radio fields are fixed.

    .. code-block:: bash

        # in the container via ``docker exec`` or ``kubectl exec``:
        python /app/bin/fix_objects_api_form_registration_variables_mapping.py
        python /app/bin/fix_radio_component_default_values.py

    Alternatively, you can also manually edit all the affected forms in the
    admin interface. For the Objects API, this would require you to remove the Objects API
    registrations, and re-define them. For the radio fields, this would require you to change
    the ``defaultValue`` of all radio components from ``null`` to an empty string ``""``.

**Bugfixes**

* [:backend:`5158`] Fixed not being able to delete ZGW API groups.
* [:backend:`5142`] Fixed logic tab crashing and incorrectly displaying 0 component
  variables when removing fields from the form.
* [:backend:`5124`] Fixed hidden prefill fields triggering validation.
* [:backend:`5031`] Fixed missing ``variables_mapping`` in the Objects API registration
  plugin.
* [:backend:`5104`] Fixed ``null`` default values for radio fields.

3.0.5 (2025-03-03)
==================

Regular bugfix release.

.. warning:: Manual intervention required

    We fixed a bug that would mess with the validation of the soft-required components.
    A script is included to fix the forms that are affected - you need to run this
    after deploying the patch release.

    .. code-block:: bash

        # in the container via ``docker exec`` or ``kubectl exec``:
        python /app/bin/fix_softrequired_component_required_validation.py

    Alternatively, you can also manually edit all the affected forms in the
    admin interface. Simply edit the soft-required components by opening the ``JSON`` view
    and within the ``validate`` key change ``required: true`` to ``required: false``.

**Bugfixes**

* [:backend:`5086`, :backend:`5090`] Fixed soft-required errors being shown for hidden
  upload fields and blocking going to the next form step.
* [:backend:`5039`] Fixed some error messages not shown properly in the Email
  Registration plugin.
* Worked around some performance issues while evaluating form logic.
* [:backend:`5089`] Fixed service fetch configuration automatically changing from
  snake-case to camel-case.

2.8.6 (2025-03-03)
==================

Regular bugfix release.

* Worked around some performance issues while evaluating form logic.
* [:backend:`5089`] Fixed service fetch configuration automatically changing from
  snake-case to camel-case.

3.1.0-alpha.1 (2025-02-20)
==========================

This is an alpha release, meaning it is not finished yet or suitable for production use.

Hotfix release for a build issue in the previous sdk version.

* Fixed build issue in the sdk, causing errors when used with the backend.

3.1.0-alpha.0 (2025-02-17)

3.0.0 "Heerlijkheid" (2025-01-09)
=================================

Open Forms 3.0.0 is a feature release.

.. epigraph::

   Until the 19th century, the countryside of North and South Holland was divided into
   hundreds of small legal-administrative units, the 'lordships' (Heerlijkheid). The current
   municipalities can be considered as a kind of successors of the former lordships. The release
   name reflects the influence of various large and smaller municipalities on this release.
   This is also a "lordly" release with many features, improvements and clean-ups.

This contains the changes from the alpha and fixes applied until the stable version.
BEFORE upgrading to 3.0.0, please read the release notes carefully and review the instructions
in the documentation under **Installation** > **Upgrade details to Open Forms 3.0.0**.

Upgrade procedure
-----------------
Open Forms 3.0 is a major version and contains a number of breaking changes. We've done a lot of
internal cleanups and removed old and deprecated features. Of course we were mindful in removing
only obsolete/unused features and we expect the impact to be minor.

To upgrade to 3.0, please:

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure you upgrade to Open Forms 2.8.2 before upgrading to the 3.0 release series.

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Please review the instructions in the documentation under **Installation** >
  **Upgrade details to Open Forms 3.0.0** before and during upgrading. You can find
  details for the deprecated code and how this might affect you.

Where possible, we have included upgrade checks that can you inform about detected problems before
any database changes are made. We will add (some) of these checks to the next 2.8.x patch release
to so you can run them to explore possible impact.

Major features
--------------

**üì• Objects API Prefill (a.k.a. product prefill)**

If you store information about requests/products for users in the Objects API, you can now use this data
to populate a form. For example to request or renew the product (object) again. Bits of information from the referenced
record are prefilled into form fields and variables.

Additionally, you can opt to update the existing object rather than create a new one during registration!

An example is defined in :ref:`Prefill examples <examples_objects_prefill>`.

**üñãÔ∏è Cosign flow improvements**

We now provide a much more intuitive user experience to have someone cosign a form submission - users need
to click less and in general we removed a lot of friction for this process.

On top of that, the new configuration options for cosign allow you to tweak the content of emails and screens
when cosigning is enabled in a form - from inviting someone to cosign to the confirmation page they get.

**üí≥ More powerful price calculations**

We made it simpler and more intuitive for form designers to define dynamic price logic rules - these are now
part of the regular logic rules. This also enables you to perform more complex calculations and interact with
external systems to retrieve pricing information!

**üõë Limiting the amount of submissions**

You can now specify a maximum number of submissions for a given form, useful for limited availability/capacity
situations, such as raffles or sign-ups to events. Related to that, we expanded the statistics to allow exporting
the successfully registered submissions.

**ü§ñ Automatic technical configuration**

We're shipping some tooling for infrastructure teams that deploy Open Forms - this makes it possible to
provision some configuration aspects that previously had to be done in the admin interface via point-and-click.

We're still expanding on the covered configuration aspects, so stay tuned for more!

**üö∏ User Experience improvements**

We have made a ton of user experience improvements in registration and prefill plugin configurations! No
more copying of URLs from other systems - instead, you select the relevant option in a dropdown.
Dropdowns that support a search field to wade through those tens or hundreds of available case types!

And, wherever you need to choose a form variable, you now have the options grouped by type of variable
*and* the context of where this variable occurs, topped of with a search field.

Detailed changes
----------------

**Breaking changes**

* [:backend:`4375`] Removed environment variable ``DISABLE_SENDING_HIDDEN_FIELDS`` for
  Objects API.
* Removed automatic patching for ``cosign_information`` template tag.
* [:backend:`3283`] Removed deprecated code (please review the instructions in the documentation
  under **Installation** > **Upgrade details to Open Forms 3.0.0** for all the necessary details):

    - ``registration_backend`` and ``registration_backend_options`` fields from form.
    - Old API location url.
    - Conversion of ``stuf-zds-create-zaak:ext-utrecht`` to ``stuf-zds-create-zaak`` during import.
    - Objecttype URL to UUID import conversion.
    - Backwards compatible styling.
    - Password Formio component.
    - Legacy formio translation converter.
    - Deprecated/disabled legacy OIDC callback endpoints by default.
    - Documented registration backend migration procedure.
    - Made Objects API and ZGW APIs group fields non-nullable where this is necessary.
    - Normalized API endpoints to use kebab-case instead of snake-case.
    - Removed unnecessary filter behaviour on form definitions endpoint.
    - Removed legacy machtigen context.
    - Removed old appointments flow and refactored code according to the new one.
    - Made submission in temporary file uploads non-nullable.
    - Removed conversion of form step URL to form step UUID.
    - Made form definition name read only.
* [:backend:`4771`] Removed price logic rules in favour of normal logic rules.

**New features**

* [:backend:`4969`] Improved the UX of the form designer:

    - The base form configuration tab now groups related fields and collapses them to declutter the UI.
    - Moved the introduction page configuration to clarify the difference with the introduction text fields.
* Registration plugins:

    * [:backend:`4686`] All the registration plugin configuration options are now consistently managed in a
      modal with better UX.

    * Email:

        * [:backend:`4650`] The email registration plugin now allows setting the recipient using form variables.
    * Objects API:

        * [:backend:`4978`] The "variables mapping" configuration is now the default - this does not affect existing
          forms.
        * Updated technical configuration documentation for Objects API.
        * [:backend:`4398`] You can now update a referenced existing object rather than create a new record.
          When the object is being updated, the BSN of the authenticated user is verified against the existing
          object data.
        * [:backend:`4418`] You can now map individual parts of the addressNL component.
    * ZGW APIs:

        * [:backend:`4606`] Improved the user experience of the plugin:

          - All dropdowns/comboboxes now have a search field.
          - You can now select which catalogue to use, which enables you to select the case and
            document types in dropdowns that show only relevant options.
          - During registration the plugin will now automatically select the right version of a case and
            document type.
          - The URL-based configuration can still be used, but it's deprecated and will be removed in the
            future.
        * [:backend:`4796`] You can now select a product to be set on the created case from the selected case
          type in the ZGW APIs registration plugin.
        * [:backend:`4344`] You can now select which Objects API group to use rather than "the first one"
          being used always.
    * StUF-ZDS:

        * [:backend:`4319`] You can now provide a custom document title for StUF-ZDS via the component
          configuration.
        * [:backend:`4762`] The cosigner identifier (BSN) is now included in the created case.
* Prefill plugins:

    * Added documentation for product prefill in user manual.

    * Objects API:

        * [:backend:`4396`, :backend:`4693`, :backend:`4608`, :backend:`4859`] You can now configure a variable
          to be prefilled from the Objects API (a.k.a. "product prefill"):

          - It's possible to assign individual properties from the object type to particular form variables.
          - To avoid duplicating configuration, you can copy the configuration from a configured registration
            backend.

* Payment plugins:

    * Ogone:

        * [:backend:`3457`] Custom ``title`` and ``com`` parameters can now be defined in Ogone payment plugin.
* [:backend:`4785`] Updated the eHerkenning metadata generation to match the latest standard version(s).
* [:backend:`4930`] It's now possible to export registered submission metadata via the form statistics

2.8.0 "Drupa" (2024-10-02)
==========================

Open Forms 2.8.0 is a feature release.

.. epigraph::

   "Drupa" is an establishment close to the offices of the Open Forms development team.
   They have provided us with the necessary caffeinated beverages and occasional snack,
   and thus indirectly and unknowingly powered the development of Open Forms üòâ.

   -- ‚òï

Upgrade notes
-------------

There are no manual actions required - all upgrades and migrations are automatic.

.. note:: The UX rework in the ZGW APIs registration plugin is not entirely finished
   yet. The Objects API integration in particular can be a bit confusing since it's not
   possible yet to select which Objects API should be used. The plugin now uses the API
   group that's listed first in the admin interface (**Admin** > **Miscellaneous** >
   **Objects API Groups**).

Major features
--------------

**üìß Email verification**

We added an additional (optional) layer of robustness for (confirmation) email delivery
and provide stronger guarantees about ownership of an email address.

You can now require email verification on email fields. Users submitting the form
receive a verification code on the provided email address, which they must enter to
confirm that it is indeed their email address. Forms with unverified email addresses
fail to submit and display useful error messages to the user.

**üìú Introduction page**

You can now define an optional introduction page that is shown *before* the users
starts the form submission. This is the ideal place to inform the users of the required
documents, what the procedure looks like or how long it typically takes to fill out the
form, for example.

**üö∏ User experience (UX) improvements**

With Open Forms, we have every ambition to make work easier for form designers.
When setting up the registration plugins that process the form submissions especially
we knew we could make substantial improvements. For the Objects API's and ZGW API's
plugins, we have reduced the need to copy-and-paste "magic" hyperlinks and aim to remove
this need entirely in the future.

For the ZGW API's, this even means you don't have to worry anymore of updating the
configuration when you publish a new version of a "zaaktype" - the right version will
now automatically be selected.

Detailed changes
----------------

This contains the changes from the alpha, beta and fixes applied between the beta and
stable version.


**New features**

* [:backend:`4267`, :backend:`4567`, :backend:`4577`] Improved the UX of the Objects
  API registration options:

    - Configuration is now in a modal and changes in configuration require an explicit
      confirmation, meaning you can now explore more without potentially breaking the
      configuration.
    - Upgraded the API group, object type and object type version dropdowns with search
      functionality.
    - Configuration fields are now logically grouped. Optional settings are shown in a
      collapsed group to declutter the UI.
    - You can now select a catalogue from a dropdown (with search functionality) that
      contains the document types to use.
    - API groups (admin): you can now specify a catalogue and the descriptions of
      document types to use rather than entering the API URL to a specific version.

  These UX and configuration improvements are still work-in-progress, more will become
  available in next releases and we will also rework the ZGW API registration options.
* [:backend:`4051`] Added a better JSON-editor in a number of places, bringing them up
  to parity with the editor in the form builder:

    - Editing JSON logic triggers.
    - Editing JSON logic variable assignment expressions.
    - Editing service fetch mapping expressions.
    - Viewing the JSON-definition of logic rules and/or actions.
* [:backend:`4555`] Improved the UX of pre-fill configuration on the variables tab:

    - There is now a single summary column for the prefill configuration, instead of
      three separate columns.
    - Improved the wording/language used to differentiate between authorizee/authorised
      roles.
    - Editing the configuration is now done in a separate modal.

* [:backend:`4456`] The admin interface now clearly displays which environment you are
  on. You can disable displaying this information, and you can change the text and
  colors to easily differentiate between acceptance/production environments.
* [:backend:`4488`] The submisson report PDF now no longer opens in a new tab/window,
  the browser is forced to download it.
* [:backend:`4432`] Improved robustness in form designer interface when crashes occur
  because of external systems.
* [:backend:`4442`] Improved certificate handling and DigiD/eHerkenning via SAML
  configuration:

    - You can now upload password-protected private keys.
    - You can now configure multiple certificates for DigiD/eHerkenning. The "next"
      certificate will be included in the generated metadata so you can seamlessly
      transition when your old certificate is about to expire.
    - The metadata files are now forced as download to prevent formatting and copy/paste
      errors.

* You can now configure some django-log-outgoing-requests settings with environment
  variables.
* [:backend:`4575`] You can now configure the ``SENDFILE_BACKEND`` with an environment
  variable.
* [:backend:`4577`] We improved the user experience when configuring the Objects API
  registration plugin. Copy-pasting URLs is being phased out - you can now select the
  relevant configurations in dropdowns.
* [:backend:`4606`] Improved the user experience of the ZGW APIs registration plugin.
  We're making this consistent with the Objects API. More improvements will be done in
  the future.
* [:backend:`4542`] Email components now support optional verification - when enabled,
  users must verify their email address before they can continue submitting the form.
* [:backend:`4582`] The SAML metadata for the DigiD/eHerkenning identity providers is
  now automatically refreshed on a weekly basis.
* [:backend:`4380`] The StUF-ZDS registration plugin now supports sending payment
  details in the ``extraElementen`` data. For 2.7 this was available in an extension,
  which has been merged in core - migrating is automatic.
* [:backend:`4545`] You can now optionally configure an introduction page, which is
  displayed before the start of the form.
* [:backend:`4543`] You can now optionally enable a short progress summary showing the
  current step number and the total number of steps in a form.

.. note:: The ``addressNL`` component is not yet a fully capable replacement for
   individual address fields. Currently, it's only recommended for BRK-validation
   purposes.

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed a crash in the validation of form variables used in logic rules.
* [:backend:`4516`] Fixed imports (and error feedback) of legacy exports with Objects
  API registration backends. It should now be more clear that admins possibly need to
  check the Objects API groups configuration.
* [:backend:`4191`] Fixed a couple of bugs when adding a company as initator in the
  ZGW API's registration plugin:

    - Fixed the datatype of ``vestiging`` field in ZGW registration rollen/betrokkenen.
    - Fixed the ``aoaIdentificatie`` being empty - this is not allowed.

* [:backend:`4533`] Fixed Objects API registration options checkboxes not toggling.
* [:backend:`4502`] Fixed a problem where the registration-backend routing logic is not
  calculated again after pausing and resuming a submission.
* [:backend:`4334`] Fixed the email registration plugin not sending a payment-received
  email when "wait for payment to register" is enabled. This behaviour is to ensure that
  financial departments can always be informed of payment administration.
* [:backend:`4519`] Fixed form variable dropdowns taking up too much horizontal space.
* Backend checks of form component validation configuration are mandatory. All components
  support the same set of validation mechanism in frontend and backend.
* [:backend:`4560`] Fixed more PDF generation overlapping content issues. The layout no
  longer uses two columns, but just stacks the labels and answers below each other since
  a compromise was not feasible.
* Fixed upgrade check scripts for 2.7.x.
* [:backend:`4597`] Revert message for not-filled-in-fields in confirmation PDF back to
  just empty space.
* Fixed processing of empty file upload components in the Objects API registration plugin.
* Fixed an upgrade check incorrectly reporting problems.
* [:backend:`4627`] Fixed a crash in the eHerkenning-via-OIDC plugin if no ActingSubjectID
  claim is present.
* [:backend:`4602`] Fixed missing Dutch translation for minimum required checked items
  error message in the selectboxes component.
* [:backend:`4587`] Fixed the product not being copied along when copying a form.

**Project maintenance**

* [:backend:`4267`] Converted more existing tests from mocks to VCR.
* Added static type checking to the CI pipeline. We will continue to improve the
  type-safety of the code, which should result in fewer bugs and improve the developer
  experience.
* Upgraded a number of third-party packages.
* Simplified testing tools to test translation-enabled forms.
* [:backend:`4492`] Upload IDs are no longer stored in the session, which was obsoleted
  by relating uploads to a submission.
* [:backend:`4534`] Applied some memory-usage optimizations when interacting with the
  Catalogi API.
* Swapped out pip-tools with `uv <https://github.com/astral-sh/uv>`_ because it has much
  better performance.
* [:backend:`3197`] Upgraded to Python 3.12 from Python 3.10.
* Fixed some more sources of test flakiness.
* The random state from factory boy is now reported in CI to help reproduce test
  flakiness issues.
* [:backend:`4380`] There is now a mock service (docker-compose based) for a StUF-ZDS
  server.
* Added CI job to test upgrade check scripts/machinery.
* Addressed broken test isolation in CI leading to flaky tests.
* Upgraded a number of dependencies to their latest (security) releases.
* Improved the static type annotations in the codebase.
* Failing end-to-end tests now produce Playwright traces in CI to help debug the problem.
* Added a utility script to find VCR cassette directories.
* [:backend:`4646`, :backend:`4396`] Restructured the Objects API configuration to be
  in a shared code package, which can be used by the registration and prefill plugins.
* [:backend:`4648`] Corrected the documentation about the minimum PostgreSQL version
  (v12) and confirmed support for PostgreSQL 15.
* Squashed migrations.

2.8.0-beta.0 (2024-09-17)
=========================

The (first) beta version for 2.8.0 is available for testing now.

.. warning:: We encourage you to test out this beta version on non-production
   environments and report your findings back to use. This release is not suitable for
   production yet though.

.. note:: The UX rework in the ZGW APIs registration plugin is not entirely finished
   yet. The Objects API integration in particular can be a bit confusing since it's not

  We're making this consistent with the Objects API. More improvements will be done in
  the future.
* [:backend:`4542`] Email components now support optional verification - when enabled,
  users must verify their email address before they can continue submitting the form.
* [:backend:`4582`] The SAML metadata for the DigiD/eHerkenning identity providers is
  now automatically refreshed on a weekly basis.
* [:backend:`4380`] The StUF-ZDS registration plugin now supports sending payment
  details in the ``extraElementen`` data. For 2.7 this was available in an extension,
  which has been merged in core - migrating is automatic.
* [:backend:`4545`] You can now optionally configure an introduction page, which is
  displayed before the start of the form.
* [:backend:`4543`] You can now optionally enable a short progress summary showing the
  current step number and the total number of steps in a form.

.. note:: The ``addressNL`` component is not yet a fully capable replacement for
   individual address fields. Currently, it's only recommended for BRK-validation
   purposes.

**Bugfixes**

* [:backend:`4597`] Revert message for not-filled-in-fields in confirmation PDF back to
  just empty space.
* Fixed processing of empty file upload components in the Objects API registration plugin.
* Fixed an upgrade check incorrectly reporting problems.
* [:backend:`4627`] Fixed a crash in the eHerkenning-via-OIDC plugin if no ActingSubjectID
  claim is present.
* [:backend:`4602`] Fixed missing Dutch translation for minimum required checked items
  error message in the selectboxes component.
* [:backend:`4587`] Fixed the product not being copied along when copying a form.

**Project maintenance**

* Addressed broken test isolation in CI leading to flaky tests.
* Upgraded a number of dependencies to their latest (security) releases.
* Improved the static type annotations in the codebase.
* Failing end-to-end tests now produce Playwright traces in CI to help debug the problem.
* Added a utility script to find VCR cassette directories.
* [:backend:`4646`, :backend:`4396`] Restructured the Objects API configuration to be
  in a shared code package, which can be used by the registration and prefill plugins.
* [:backend:`4648`] Corrected the documentation about the minimum PostgreSQL version
  (v12) and confirmed support for PostgreSQL 15.
* Squashed migrations.

2.8.0-alpha.0 (2024-08-09)
==========================

This is an alpha release, meaning it is not finished yet or suitable for production use.

Detailed changes
----------------

**New features**

* [:backend:`4267`, :backend:`4567`, :backend:`4577`] Improved the UX of the Objects
  API registration options:

    - Configuration is now in a modal and changes in configuration require an explicit
      confirmation, meaning you can now explore more without potentially breaking the
      configuration.
    - Upgraded the API group, object type and object type version dropdowns with search
      functionality.
    - Configuration fields are now logically grouped. Optional settings are shown in a
      collapsed group to declutter the UI.
    - You can now select a catalogue from a dropdown (with search functionality) that
      contains the document types to use.
    - API groups (admin): you can now specify a catalogue and the descriptions of
      document types to use rather than entering the API URL to a specific version.

  These UX and configuration improvements are still work-in-progress, more will become
  available in next releases and we will also rework the ZGW API registration options.
* [:backend:`4051`] Added a better JSON-editor in a number of places, bringing them up
  to parity with the editor in the form builder:

    - Editing JSON logic triggers.
    - Editing JSON logic variable assignment expressions.
    - Editing service fetch mapping expressions.
    - Viewing the JSON-definition of logic rules and/or actions.
* [:backend:`4555`] Improved the UX of pre-fill configuration on the variables tab:

    - There is now a single summary column for the prefill configuration, instead of
      three separate columns.
    - Improved the wording/language used to differentiate between authorizee/authorised
      roles.
    - Editing the configuration is now done in a separate modal.

* [:backend:`4456`] The admin interface now clearly displays which environment you are
  on. You can disable displaying this information, and you can change the text and
  colors to easily differentiate between acceptance/production environments.
* [:backend:`4488`] The submisson report PDF now no longer opens in a new tab/window,
  the browser is forced to download it.
* Support pre-filling form fields from existing data in the Objects API:

    - [:backend:`4397`] Added ability to store an object reference on the submission so
      that the information can be retrieve and pre-filled.
    - [:backend:`4395`] Added a flag to specify if an existing object needs to be
      updated during registration, or a new record should be created.

  This feature is currently under heavy development.
* [:backend:`4432`] Improved robustness in form designer interface when crashes occur
  because of external systems.
* [:backend:`4442`] Improved certificate handling and DigiD/eHerkenning via SAML
  configuration:

    - You can now upload password-protected private keys.
    - You can now configure multiple certificates for DigiD/eHerkenning. The "next"
      certificate will be included in the generated metadata so you can seamlessly
      transition when your old certificate is about to expire.
    - The metadata files are now forced as download to prevent formatting and copy/paste
      errors.

* [:backend:`4380`] You can now include more payment details/information in the StUF-ZDS
  and Objects API registration plugins:

    - Added support for storing and including the payment ID from the payment provider.
    - Added support to send the order ID, payment status and payment amount as
      ``extraElementen`` in StUF-ZDS.

  .. note:: Currently this requires the ``open-forms-ext-stuf-zds-payments`` extension,
     but it will land in Open Forms core in the future.

* You can now configure some django-log-outgoing-requests settings with environment
  variables.
* [:backend:`4575`] You can now configure the ``SENDFILE_BACKEND`` with an environment
  variable.

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed a crash in the validation of form variables used in logic rules.
* [:backend:`4516`] Fixed imports (and error feedback) of legacy exports with Objects
  API registration backends. It should now be more clear that admins possibly need to
  check the Objects API groups configuration.
* [:backend:`4191`] Fixed a couple of bugs when adding a company as initator in the
  ZGW API's registration plugin:

    - Fixed the datatype of ``vestiging`` field in ZGW registration rollen/betrokkenen.
    - Fixed the ``aoaIdentificatie`` being empty - this is not allowed.

* [:backend:`4533`] Fixed Objects API registration options checkboxes not toggling.
* [:backend:`4502`] Fixed a problem where the registration-backend routing logic is not
  calculated again after pausing and resuming a submission.
* [:backend:`4334`] Fixed the email registration plugin not sending a payment-received
  email when "wait for payment to register" is enabled. This behaviour is to ensure that
  financial departments can always be informed of payment administration.
* [:backend:`4519`] Fixed form variable dropdowns taking up too much horizontal space.
* Backend checks of form component validation configuration are mandatory. All components
  support the same set of validation mechanism in frontend and backend.
* [:backend:`4560`] Fixed more PDF generation overlapping content issues. The layout no
  longer uses two columns, but just stacks the labels and answers below each other since
  a compromise was not feasible.
* Fixed upgrade check scripts for 2.7.x.

**Project maintenance**

* [:backend:`4267`] Converted more existing tests from mocks to VCR.
* Added static type checking to the CI pipeline. We will continue to improve the
  type-safety of the code, which should result in fewer bugs and improve the developer
  experience.
* Upgraded a number of third-party packages.
* Simplified testing tools to test translation-enabled forms.
* [:backend:`4492`] Upload IDs are no longer stored in the session, which was obsoleted
  by relating uploads to a submission.
* [:backend:`4534`] Applied some memory-usage optimizations when interacting with the
  Catalogi API.
* Swapped out pip-tools with `uv <https://github.com/astral-sh/uv>`_ because it has much
  better performance.
* [:backend:`3197`] Upgraded to Python 3.12 from Python 3.10.
* Fixed some more sources of test flakiness.
* The random state from factory boy is now reported in CI to help reproduce test
  flakiness issues.
* [:backend:`4380`] There is now a mock service (docker-compose based) for a StUF-ZDS
  server.
* Added CI job to test upgrade check scripts/machinery.
